## 💡 How to Use

### Initialize Database
```bash
python3 db_setup.py
```

Output:
```
✓ Database created successfully
✓ Added Dr. Dr. Sarah Johnson (Neurology - Stroke Specialist)
✓ Added Dr. Dr. Michael Chen (Emergency Medicine)
✓ Added Dr. Dr. Aisha Khan (Rehabilitation & Recovery)
  📊 Total doctors added: 3
  📊 Total patients added: 4
  📊 Total appointments added: 2
  📊 Availability Slots: 30
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python3 test_scheduler.py
```

### Programmatic Usage

#### Check Availability
```python
from modules.scheduler import AppointmentScheduler
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

scheduler = AppointmentScheduler()

# Get doctor
doctors = scheduler.get_all_doctors()
doctor = doctors[0]

# Check tomorrow's availability
tomorrow = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)).date()
slots = scheduler.get_doctor_availability(doctor['doctor_id'], tomorrow)

print(f"Found {len(slots)} available slots")
scheduler.display_available_slots(slots, doctor['name'])
```

#### Book Appointment
```python
# Create/get patient
user_id = scheduler.get_or_create_patient(
    name="John Doe",
    email="john@email.com",
    phone="555-1234"
)

# Book appointment
success, message, appointment_id = scheduler.book_appointment(
    user_id=user_id,
    doctor_id=1,
    appointment_date="2025-10-30",
    start_time="10:00",
    reason="Follow-up consultation"
)

if success:
    print(f"Booked! Appointment ID: {appointment_id}")
```

#### With Calendar Integration
```python
from modules.calendar_integration import CalendarIntegration

integration = CalendarIntegration()

# Book and sync to calendar
success, message, appt_id = integration.book_appointment_with_calendar(
    user_id=user_id,
    doctor_id=1,
    appointment_date="2025-10-30",
    start_time="14:00",
    reason="Initial consultation",
    create_calendar_event=True  # Syncs to Google Calendar
)
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Availability Algorithm
1. Get doctor's weekly schedule (day_of_week table)
2. Generate time slots based on consultation_duration (30 min)
3. Fetch existing appointments for that date
4. Filter out booked slots
5. Return available slots

### Conflict Detection
- Checks for overlapping appointments: `NOT (end <= start OR start >= end)`
- Excludes cancelled appointments from conflict check
- Handles timezone consistency (all times in local)

### Status Flow
```
scheduled → confirmed → completed
         ↘ cancelled
```

### Calendar Integration
- Uses existing `calendar_assistant.py` via Pipedream
- Creates Google Calendar events with:
  - Patient and doctor emails
  - Appointment details
  - Automatic email notifications
- Stores `calendar_event_id` in database
- Supports create, update, cancel operations
