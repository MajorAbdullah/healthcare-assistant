STROKE PREVENTION GUIDE

Understanding Your Risk

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and a major cause of disability. However, up to 80% of strokes can be prevented through lifestyle changes and medical management.

CONTROLLABLE RISK FACTORS

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)

High blood pressure is the leading cause of stroke. It damages blood vessels throughout the body, including the brain.

Prevention Steps:
- Monitor blood pressure regularly (target: below 120/80 mmHg)
- Take prescribed medications consistently
- Reduce sodium intake (less than 2,300 mg daily)
- Limit processed foods
- Practice stress reduction techniques

High Cholesterol

Excess cholesterol can build up in artery walls, making them narrower and increasing stroke risk.

Prevention Steps:
- Get cholesterol checked regularly
- Limit saturated fats (butter, red meat, full-fat dairy)
- Eat more fiber (oats, beans, fruits, vegetables)
- Consider statins if prescribed
- Aim for LDL below 100 mg/dL

Diabetes

Diabetes damages blood vessels over time, increasing stroke risk up to 4 times.

Prevention Steps:
- Keep blood sugar levels in target range
- Monitor HbA1c levels (target: below 7%)
- Take medications as prescribed
- Check feet daily for sores
- Schedule regular eye exams

Heart Disease

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and other heart conditions increase stroke risk significantly.

Prevention Steps:
- Take blood thinners if prescribed for AFib
- Monitor heart rhythm regularly
- Manage other heart conditions
- Follow cardiologist recommendations
- Consider ablation if recommended

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS

Quit Smoking

Smoking doubles your stroke risk by damaging blood vessels and raising blood pressure.

How to Quit:
- Set a quit date
- Use nicotine replacement therapy
- Join a support group
- Ask your doctor about medications
- Avoid triggers and smoking environments
- Remember: Risk decreases significantly within 2-4 years of quitting

Maintain Healthy Weight

Obesity contributes to high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.

Weight Management:
- Calculate your BMI (target: 18.5-24.9)
- Measure waist circumference (men <40", women <35")
- Set realistic weight loss goals (1-2 pounds per week)
- Track food intake
- Practice portion control

Exercise Regularly

Physical activity strengthens your heart and improves circulation.

Exercise Guidelines:
- Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly
- Include strength training twice weekly
- Start slowly if you're inactive
- Find activities you enjoy (walking, swimming, cycling)
- Break it up: Three 10-minute sessions count too
- Consult doctor before starting intense exercise

Eat a Healthy Diet

The Mediterranean and DASH diets are proven to reduce stroke risk.

Dietary Recommendations:
- Eat 5+ servings of fruits and vegetables daily
- Choose whole grains over refined grains
- Include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) twice weekly
- Limit red meat to 1-2 servings weekly
- Use olive oil instead of butter
- Reduce sodium to less than 2,300 mg daily
- Limit added sugars
- Stay hydrated with water

Limit Alcohol Consumption

Heavy drinking raises blood pressure and stroke risk.

Guidelines:
- Men: Maximum 2 drinks per day
- Women: Maximum 1 drink per day
- One drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz spirits
- Consider avoiding alcohol entirely if you have risk factors

MEDICAL PREVENTION

Regular Health Screenings

Early detection and treatment of risk factors is crucial.

Recommended Screenings:
- Blood pressure: At every doctor visit
- Cholesterol: Every 4-6 years (more often if abnormal)
- Diabetes: Every 3 years starting at age 45
- Heart health: Annual physical exam
- Weight/BMI: At each visit

Medications

Your doctor may prescribe medications to prevent stroke:

- Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel): Prevent blood clots
- Anticoagulants (warfarin, newer agents): For AFib and other conditions
- Blood pressure medications: Various types to lower BP
- Statins: Lower cholesterol
- Diabetes medications: Control blood sugar

Take all medications exactly as prescribed. Never stop medications without consulting your doctor.

RECOGNIZE TIA (Mini-Stroke)

A TIA is a warning sign that a major stroke may occur.

TIA Characteristics:
- Same symptoms as stroke but temporary
- Usually lasts less than 5 minutes
- No permanent damage
- 1 in 3 people who have a TIA will have a major stroke
- Half of major strokes after TIA occur within 1 year

If you experience TIA symptoms, seek immediate medical attention even if symptoms resolve.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Women and Stroke

Women have unique stroke risk factors:
- Pregnancy complications
- Preeclampsia
- Birth control pills (especially with smoking)
- Hormone replacement therapy
- Migraine with aura

Discuss these risks with your healthcare provider.

Age and Family History

You can't control these factors, but awareness helps:
- Stroke risk doubles each decade after 55
- Family history increases risk
- Previous stroke increases risk of recurrence
- Focus on controlling modifiable risk factors
