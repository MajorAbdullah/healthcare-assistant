STROKE: WARNING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

What is a Stroke?

A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes.

A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.

WARNING SIGNS - F.A.S.T.

The acronym F.A.S.T. is an easy way to remember the sudden signs of stroke:

F - Face Drooping: Does one side of the face droop or is it numb? Ask the person to smile. Is the person's smile uneven or lopsided?

A - Arm Weakness: Is one arm weak or numb? Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?

S - Speech Difficulty: Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand? Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence.

T - Time to Call 911: If the person shows any of these symptoms, even temporarily, call 911 immediately. Check the time so you'll know when the first symptoms appeared.

ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS

Other stroke symptoms include:

- Sudden numbness or weakness in the leg
- Sudden confusion or trouble understanding speech
- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or lack of coordination
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause

TYPES OF STROKE

Ischemic Stroke: About 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes, which occur when blood clots or other particles block the blood vessels to the brain.

Hemorrhagic Stroke: A hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The leaked blood puts too much pressure on brain cells and damages them.

Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Sometimes called a "mini-stroke," a TIA is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. A TIA doesn't cause permanent damage but is a serious warning sign.

RISK FACTORS

Many factors can increase your stroke risk:

Medical Risk Factors:
- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- High cholesterol
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Previous stroke or TIA

Lifestyle Risk Factors:
- Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
- Physical inactivity
- Heavy alcohol use
- Use of illegal drugs

PREVENTION

You can take steps to prevent stroke:

1. Control high blood pressure: This is the single most important thing you can do.
2. Lower cholesterol: High cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup in arteries.
3. Don't smoke: Smoking doubles stroke risk.
4. Exercise regularly: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly.
5. Maintain healthy weight: Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors.
6. Eat a healthy diet: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
7. Manage diabetes: Keep blood sugar levels under control.
8. Limit alcohol: If you drink, do so in moderation.

TREATMENT

Treatment depends on the type of stroke:

For Ischemic Stroke:
- Clot-busting drugs (tPA) must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
- Mechanical thrombectomy to physically remove the clot
- Blood thinners to prevent future clots

For Hemorrhagic Stroke:
- Surgery to repair the blood vessel
- Medications to reduce pressure in the brain
- Procedures to prevent future bleeding

RECOVERY AND REHABILITATION

Stroke recovery varies widely. Some people recover completely, while others have long-term or lifelong disabilities. Rehabilitation may include:

- Physical therapy to improve movement and balance
- Occupational therapy to relearn daily activities
- Speech therapy to improve communication and swallowing
- Psychological support to address emotional effects

TIME IS CRITICAL

Remember: Time lost is brain lost. The faster you act, the better the chance of recovery. If you suspect someone is having a stroke, call emergency services immediately.
