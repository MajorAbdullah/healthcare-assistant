# Stroke: Understanding the Basics

## What is a Stroke?

A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes.

A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.

## Types of Strokes

### Ischemic Stroke
This is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 87% of all strokes. It occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain. Blood clots often form in areas where the arteries have been narrowed or blocked over time by fatty deposits known as plaques.

### Hemorrhagic Stroke
This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. Hemorrhagic strokes can result from conditions such as high blood pressure, trauma, blood-thinning medications, and aneurysms.

### Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
Sometimes called a "mini-stroke," a TIA is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those in a stroke. A TIA doesn't cause permanent damage and is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain.

## Warning Signs and Symptoms

The F.A.S.T. acronym can help you remember the warning signs of a stroke:

- **F**ace drooping: Does one side of the face droop or is it numb? Ask the person to smile.
- **A**rm weakness: Is one arm weak or numb? Ask the person to raise both arms.
- **S**peech difficulty: Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand?
- **T**ime to call emergency services: If someone shows any of these symptoms, even temporarily, call emergency services immediately.

Other symptoms may include:
- Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech
- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause

## Risk Factors

### Controllable Risk Factors:
- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Obesity and physical inactivity
- Cardiovascular disease
- Previous stroke or TIA
- High levels of stress
- Drug use, especially cocaine and methamphetamines
- Alcohol abuse

### Uncontrollable Risk Factors:
- Age (risk increases with age, especially after 55)
- Race (African Americans have higher risk)
- Sex (men have higher risk, but women have higher death rates)
- Family history of stroke
- Previous stroke or TIA

## Prevention

Many strokes can be prevented through lifestyle changes:

1. **Control high blood pressure**: This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk.

2. **Lower cholesterol levels**: High cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup in arteries.

3. **Don't smoke**: If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start.

4. **Manage diabetes**: High blood sugar damages blood vessels over time.

5. **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors.

6. **Exercise regularly**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days.

7. **Eat a healthy diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

8. **Limit alcohol**: Drink only in moderation.

9. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress may contribute to stroke risk.

10. **Avoid illegal drugs**: Cocaine and other drugs can cause strokes.

## Treatment

Stroke treatment depends on the type of stroke:

### Ischemic Stroke Treatment:
- **Emergency IV medication**: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is given through a vein in the arm to dissolve the clot causing the stroke. This must be given within 4.5 hours from symptom onset.
- **Emergency endovascular procedures**: Doctors may use catheter-based treatments to remove the clot directly.
- **Other procedures**: May include carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty and stents.

### Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment:
- **Emergency measures**: May include medication to reduce blood pressure or control bleeding.
- **Surgical procedures**: May be necessary to remove blood from the brain or repair damaged blood vessels.

## Recovery and Rehabilitation

Recovery from stroke varies widely. Some people recover completely, while others have long-term or lifelong disabilities. Rehabilitation may include:

- **Physical therapy**: To improve mobility, balance, and coordination
- **Occupational therapy**: To help regain skills needed for daily activities
- **Speech therapy**: For problems with language and swallowing
- **Psychological counseling**: To address depression and emotional challenges

## Time is Critical

Remember: Time lost is brain lost. Every minute counts when someone is having a stroke. The faster treatment begins, the better the chance of recovery and reduced disability.

If you think someone is having a stroke, call emergency services immediately. Don't wait to see if symptoms go awayâ€”immediate treatment can save lives and increase the chances of a full recovery.
