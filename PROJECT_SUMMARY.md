# 🎯 Healthcare Assistant Prototype - Executive Summary

## 📌 Quick Overview

**Project**: Healthcare Assistant (RAG + Appointment Scheduling)  
**Goal**: Build a comprehensive prototype combining medical education with doctor appointments  
**Timeline**: 11-14 days  
**Status**: Planning Complete ✅  

---

## 🎪 What We're Building

A **dual-purpose AI system** where:

1. **Patients learn about stroke** through conversational AI with cited medical sources
2. **Patients book appointments** with doctors using real Google Calendar integration  
3. **Doctors manage bookings** through a confirmation workflow
4. **System remembers everything** for personalized future interactions

Think: **"WebMD + Zocdoc"** but smarter, powered by RAG and real calendar integration.

- **Database**: SQLite (users, appointments, conversations)
- **CLI**: Rich library (beautiful terminal interface)
- **Language**: Python 3.7+

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1️⃣ RAG-Based Medical Q&A

**How it works:**
```
Question → Embed → Search Vector DB → Retrieve Docs → Generate Answer + Citations
```

**Example:**
- **Q**: "What are the symptoms of a stroke?"
- **A**: "Sudden numbness or weakness in face [1], trouble speaking [2], severe headache [3]..."
- **Sources**: [1] Mayo Clinic, [2] WHO, [3] CDC

### 2️⃣ Smart Appointment Scheduling

**How it works:**
```
Request → Parse → Check Calendar → Detect Conflicts → Book → Notify Doctor → Confirm
```

**Example:**
- Patient: "Book with Dr. Johnson tomorrow at 2pm"
- System: ✅ Available! Created PENDING appointment
- Doctor: Reviews → Confirms
- System: ✅ Calendar updated, patient notified

### 3️⃣ Memory & Personalization

**How it works:**
```
Save All Interactions → Build User Profile → Context-Aware Responses
```

**Example:**
- First visit: "How can I help you today?"
- Return visit: "Welcome back! Last time you asked about stroke prevention. You have an appointment with Dr. Johnson on Oct 28."

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Medical Education
```
👤 Patient: What are the early warning signs of a stroke?

🤖 System: [Searches vector DB for relevant chunks]

🤖 Assistant: The early warning signs include:
   • Sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side [1]
   • Confusion or trouble speaking [2]
   • Vision problems in one or both eyes [2]
   • Severe headache with no known cause [3]
   
   Remember F.A.S.T. [1]:
   - Face drooping
   - Arm weakness
   - Speech difficulty
   - Time to call emergency services
   
   Sources:
   [1] Mayo Clinic - Stroke Symptoms Guide, pg. 2
   [2] WHO Fact Sheet - Warning Signs
   [3] CDC Stroke Prevention, pg. 5

👤 Patient: How can I prevent stroke?

🤖 System: [Retrieves context from previous conversation]
           [Searches for prevention information]

🤖 Assistant: Based on medical guidelines, stroke prevention includes...
   [Answer with citations continues...]
```

### Scenario 2: Appointment Booking
```
👤 Patient: I want to book an appointment with a neurologist

🤖 Assistant: I can help you book with our stroke specialist:
   
   Dr. Sarah Johnson - Neurology, Stroke Specialist
   Available slots this week:
   • Tuesday, Oct 28: 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 4:00 PM
   • Wednesday, Oct 29: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM
   • Thursday, Oct 30: 10:00 AM, 1:00 PM
   
   Which time works for you?

👤 Patient: Tuesday at 2 PM

🤖 System: [Checks patient's calendar]
           [Checks doctor's calendar]
           [No conflicts found]

🤖 Assistant: ✅ Perfect! I've created an appointment:
   
   Doctor: Dr. Sarah Johnson
   Date: Tuesday, October 28, 2025
   Time: 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM
   Status: PENDING (awaiting doctor confirmation)
   
   You'll receive a confirmation once Dr. Johnson approves.
   The appointment has been added to your calendar.

[Later, doctor logs in...]

👩‍⚕️ Dr. Johnson: [Views pending appointments]
                  [Sees: John Doe, Oct 28, 2:00 PM, Reason: Stroke consultation]
                  [Clicks: CONFIRM]

🤖 System: ✅ Appointment confirmed!
   [Updates calendar event color: yellow → green]
   [Notifies patient via console message]

📧 Notification to Patient:
   "Your appointment with Dr. Johnson on Oct 28 at 2:00 PM has been confirmed!"
```

### Scenario 3: Conflict Prevention
```
👤 Patient: Book me with Dr. Johnson tomorrow at 2 PM

🤖 System: [Checks calendar]
           [Detects conflict: Patient has existing appointment at 2:30 PM]

🤖 Assistant: ⚠️ Scheduling conflict detected!
   
   You already have an appointment at:
   • 2:30 PM - Dr. Chen (Follow-up visit)
   
   The 2:00 PM slot would overlap with your existing appointment.
   
   Would you like to:
   1. Choose a different time (10:00 AM or 4:00 PM available)
   2. Reschedule your existing 2:30 PM appointment
   3. Cancel this request
   
   What would you prefer?

👤 Patient: Let's do 4 PM instead

🤖 Assistant: Great choice! Booking for 4:00 PM...
   [Creates appointment successfully]
```

## 📈 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Citation Accuracy
**Problem**: Ensuring citations match actual source material  
**Solution**: Store chunk metadata with source, page, section; verify in post-processing

### Challenge 2: Calendar Conflicts
**Problem**: Preventing double-booking across patient and doctor calendars  
**Solution**: Check both calendars using formula: `(new_start < existing_end) AND (new_end > existing_start)`

### Challenge 3: Context Management
**Problem**: Maintaining conversation context without overwhelming LLM  
**Solution**: Keep last 10 messages in active memory, full history in DB, retrieve as needed

### Challenge 4: Answer Quality
**Problem**: Ensuring medically accurate responses  
**Solution**: Use curated sources only, explicit prompt instructions, low temperature (0.1)

## 📞 Questions to Consider

Before starting implementation:

1. **Medical Documents**: Do we have access to stroke PDFs, or should we web-scrape public health sites?
2. **Real Doctors**: Use real doctor calendars or simulate with separate Google accounts?
3. **Web UI Priority**: Focus on CLI first and web later, or parallel development?
4. **Deployment**: Local prototype only, or plan for cloud deployment?
5. **Data Privacy**: How to handle patient data securely (HIPAA considerations)?
