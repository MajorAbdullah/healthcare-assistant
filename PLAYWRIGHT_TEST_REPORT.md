```json
{
  "appointment_id": 28,
  "user_id": 22,
  "doctor_id": 1,
  "appointment_date": "2025-10-29",
  "start_time": "11:00",
  "end_time": "11:30",
  "status": "scheduled",
  "reason": "Playwright automated test - Follow-up consultation for neurological assessment",
  "notes": null,
  "calendar_event_id": null,
  "created_at": "2025-10-29 09:00:19",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-29 09:00:19",
  "patient_name": "Playwright Test User",
  "patient_email": "playwright.test@example.com",
  "patient_phone": "555-PLAY-01"

## Comparison: API Test vs Playwright Test

| Feature | API Test (cURL) | Playwright UI Test | Status |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| User Registration | ✅ Manual API call | ✅ Automated UI flow | Both Working |
| Doctor Selection | ✅ Direct ID | ✅ UI selection | Both Working |
| Date/Time Selection | ✅ Direct values | ✅ Calendar/Time picker | Both Working |
| Appointment Booking | ✅ Created | ✅ Created | Both Working |
| Database Storage | ✅ Saved | ✅ Saved | Both Working |
| Doctor Portal Display | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | Both Working |
| **Google Calendar Sync** | ✅ **Working** (`event_1761727979.136863`) | ❌ **Not Working** (`null`) | **API Only** |

---

## Issue Identified: Frontend Calendar Sync

### Problem
The frontend booking flow does NOT sync appointments to Google Calendar, while the API endpoint DOES sync when `sync_calendar: true` is passed.

### Root Cause
The frontend is likely not sending the `sync_calendar: true` parameter when booking appointments.

### Evidence
1. **API Test Appointment (ID: 27):**
   - calendar_event_id: `event_1761727979.136863` ✅
   - Synced successfully to Google Calendar
   - Visible in calendar screenshot at 10:00 AM

2. **Playwright UI Test Appointment (ID: 28):**
   - calendar_event_id: `null` ❌
   - NOT synced to Google Calendar
   - Only visible in database and portals

### Recommendation
Update the frontend booking component to include `sync_calendar: true` in the API request payload.

**Frontend Code to Check:**
- File: Likely in `Frontend/src/pages/patient/BookAppointment.tsx` or similar
- API call: Check the POST request to `/api/v1/appointments`
- Add: `sync_calendar: true` to the request body

- ✅ Form filling works smoothly
- ✅ Navigation flow is stable

### Areas for Improvement
- Add explicit calendar sync verification
- Add screenshot comparison tests
- Implement retry logic for flaky elements

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Calendar Sync in Frontend
**File to Update:** `Frontend/src/` (booking component)
**Change Needed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (assumed)
const bookingData = {
  user_id: userId,
  doctor_id: selectedDoctor,
  date: selectedDate,
  time: selectedTime,
  reason: reason
};

// AFTER
const bookingData = {
  user_id: userId,
  doctor_id: selectedDoctor,
  date: selectedDate,
  time: selectedTime,
  reason: reason,
  sync_calendar: true  // ADD THIS LINE
};
```

### Priority 2: Fix Date Display Issue
The appointment shows "Oct 29" in the UI but was booked for "Oct 30". This might be a timezone conversion issue.

### Priority 3: Add Calendar Sync Toggle
Consider adding a checkbox in the booking confirmation step:
```
☑️ Sync to Google Calendar
```

## Conclusion

**Overall Status:** ✅ 89% Pass Rate (8/9 tests passing)

The Playwright automation successfully demonstrates:
- Complete end-to-end user registration flow
- Full appointment booking workflow
- Dual portal verification (patient + doctor)
- Database persistence
- UI/UX functionality

**Critical Finding:** The frontend needs to be updated to enable Google Calendar sync. The backend API fully supports this feature and works correctly when the proper parameter is sent.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update frontend to pass `sync_calendar: true`
2. Rerun Playwright test to verify calendar sync
3. Add automated visual regression tests
4. Implement calendar event ID verification in UI
