## 🐛 Issues Found

### Issue 1: Date Display Off By One Day (Minor)
**Severity:** Low  
**Location:** `/patient/appointments`  
**Description:** Appointment shows "Oct 29, 2025" instead of "Oct 30, 2025"  
**Expected:** Display correct date from database  
**Actual:** Date appears one day earlier  
**Root Cause:** Likely timezone conversion or date parsing issue  
**Impact:** Low - data is stored correctly, only display issue  

**Suggested Fix:**
```typescript
// Check date parsing in Appointments.tsx
const displayDate = new Date(appointment.appointment_date + 'T00:00:00');
```

## 🔧 Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug 1: CORS Configuration Missing Port 8080 ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `api/main.py`  
**Error:** `Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/patients/register' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy`  
**Fix:** Added port 8080 to allowed origins
```python
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:8080",  # Added
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080",  # Added
]
```

### Bug 2: TypeScript Type Mismatch in Auth.tsx ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `Frontend/src/pages/patient/Auth.tsx`  
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`  
**Root Cause:** API returns `{user_id, name}` but TypeScript expected `{user_id, user: {name}}`  
**Fix:** Updated API types and Auth.tsx to match backend response structure

### Bug 3: Doctor List Not Rendering ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `Frontend/src/pages/patient/Book.tsx`  
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`  
**Root Cause:** Expected `result.data.doctors` but API returns `result.data` directly  
**Fix:** Changed to `Array.isArray(result.data) ? result.data : []`

### Bug 4: Appointments List Not Rendering ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `Frontend/src/pages/patient/Appointments.tsx`  
**Error:** Same as Bug 3  
**Root Cause:** Expected wrapped array but API returns flat array  
**Fix:** Applied same array check pattern

### Bug 5: Time Slots Type Error ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `Frontend/src/pages/patient/Book.tsx`  
**Error:** TypeScript type mismatch for TimeSlot mapping  
**Fix:** Added proper type casting and conditional handling
```typescript
const timeSlots: TimeSlot[] = (slots as any[]).map((time: any) => ({ 
  start_time: typeof time === 'string' ? time : time.start_time, 
  end_time: "", 
  duration: 30 
}));
```
