**‚ùå Critical Issue Discovered**:
- **WRONG DATE IN DATABASE**: Appointment showing in "Today's Schedule" (Oct 29)
- **Expected**: Should be in tomorrow's schedule (Oct 30)
- **Actual**: Saved as Oct 29 in database

**Database Query Result**:
```sql
SELECT appointment_id, user_id, doctor_id, appointment_date, start_time, reason, status, calendar_event_id 
FROM appointments 
WHERE user_id = 19;

Result: 18|19|1|2025-10-29|14:00|Follow-up consultation...|scheduled|
                  ^^^^^^^^^^
                  WRONG DATE! Should be 2025-10-30

### Step 5: Calendar Page Verification ‚ùå

**Action**: Navigate to Calendar page and check Oct 29 & Oct 30  
**Result**: ‚ùå **FAIL**

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigated to /doctor/calendar ‚úÖ
2. Clicked on Oct 29 (today) ‚Üí "No appointments scheduled for this date" ‚ùå
3. Clicked on Oct 30 (tomorrow) ‚Üí "No appointments scheduled for this date" ‚ùå

## üêõ Bugs Identified

### Bug #1: Date Mismatch on Appointment Booking üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Backend API - Appointment Creation  
**File**: Likely in `api/main.py` or booking endpoint

**Description**:
When user selects **October 30, 2025** in the booking UI, the appointment is saved as **October 29, 2025** in the database.

**Evidence**:
- UI showed: "Thursday, October 30, 2025"
- Database shows: `appointment_date = 2025-10-29`
- Dashboard shows appointment under "Today's Schedule" (Oct 29) instead of tomorrow

**Expected Behavior**:
Appointment date in database should match the date selected in UI

**Actual Behavior**:
Date is off by 1 day (saved as previous day)

**Root Cause (Hypothesis)**:
Possible timezone conversion issue or date parsing bug in backend. The server might be:
- Converting UTC to local time incorrectly
- Using `CURRENT_DATE` instead of user-selected date
- Date object being manipulated incorrectly

---

### Bug #2: Calendar Page Not Displaying Appointments üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Frontend - Doctor Calendar Page  
**File**: `Frontend/src/pages/doctor/Calendar.tsx`

**Description**:
Calendar page shows "No appointments scheduled for this date" even when appointments exist in the database for that date.

**Evidence**:
- Database has appointment_id=18 for Oct 29
- Dashboard shows the same appointment correctly
- Calendar page shows empty state for both Oct 29 and Oct 30

**Expected Behavior**:
Calendar page should fetch and display all appointments for the selected date

**Actual Behavior**:
No appointments displayed on calendar page regardless of selected date

**Root Cause (Hypothesis)**:
1. API endpoint `/api/v1/doctor/{doctor_id}/appointments` might have date filter issues
2. Query parameter formatting (date format mismatch)
3. Frontend not passing correct date format to backend
4. Backend returning empty array despite DB having data

---

### Bug #3: Google Calendar Integration Not Working ‚ùå **HIGH**

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Backend API - Pipedream Integration  
**File**: Likely in appointment creation endpoint

**Description**:
When appointment is created, no Google Calendar event is being created and no `calendar_event_id` is saved.

**Evidence**:
- `calendar_event_id` column is NULL/empty in database
- No webhook call to Pipedream visible in logs

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Appointment created ‚Üí Pipedream webhook triggered
2. Pipedream creates Google Calendar event
3. Event ID returned and saved in `calendar_event_id` column

**Actual Behavior**:
No calendar event created, column remains empty

**Root Cause (Hypothesis)**:
1. Pipedream workflow URL not configured in backend
2. API endpoint not calling Pipedream webhook
3. Workflow failing but no error handling
4. Google Calendar API authentication issues

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Date Mismatch Issue

**Location**: `api/main.py` - Appointment creation endpoint

**Problem**:
```python
# Current (hypothetical)
appointment_date = datetime.now().date()  # WRONG!
```

**Solution**:
```python
# Correct
appointment_date = request_data['appointment_date']  # Use user's selected date
# Or
appointment_date = datetime.strptime(request_data['appointment_date'], '%Y-%m-%d').date()
```

**Verification**:
- Book appointment for Oct 30
- Check database: `appointment_date` should be `2025-10-30`
- Check dashboard: Should show in "Tomorrow's" or "Upcoming" schedule, NOT today's

---

### Fix #2: Calendar Page Display Issue

**Location**: `Frontend/src/pages/doctor/Calendar.tsx`

**Problem**: API call might not be passing date correctly or backend query is wrong

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check network tab for API request: `/api/v1/doctor/1/appointments?date=2025-10-29`
2. Verify backend endpoint accepts and processes date parameter
3. Check response body - is it empty array or appointments?

**Potential Fix** (Frontend):
```typescript
// Ensure date is formatted correctly
const formattedDate = selectedDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // YYYY-MM-DD
const response = await api.doctor.getAppointments(doctorId, { date: formattedDate });
```

**Potential Fix** (Backend):
```python
# In appointment query
selected_date = request.args.get('date')  # Get date from query param
appointments = db.query(Appointment).filter(
    Appointment.doctor_id == doctor_id,
    Appointment.appointment_date == selected_date  # Filter by date
).all()
```

---

### Fix #3: Google Calendar Integration

**Location**: `api/main.py` - POST `/api/v1/appointments`

**Implementation**:
```python
import requests

def create_appointment(appointment_data):
    # 1. Save appointment to database
    appointment = save_to_database(appointment_data)
    
    # 2. Call Pipedream webhook
    try:
        pipedream_url = os.getenv('PIPEDREAM_WEBHOOK_URL')
        payload = {
            'patient_name': appointment.patient_name,
            'doctor_name': appointment.doctor_name,
            'appointment_date': str(appointment.appointment_date),
            'start_time': str(appointment.start_time),
            'end_time': str(appointment.end_time),
            'reason': appointment.reason
        }
        
        response = requests.post(pipedream_url, json=payload, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # 3. Get calendar event ID from response
        calendar_event_id = response.json().get('event_id')
        
        # 4. Update appointment with calendar_event_id
        appointment.calendar_event_id = calendar_event_id
        db.commit()
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error but don't fail appointment creation
        logger.error(f"Failed to sync with Google Calendar: {e}")
    
    return appointment
```

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
# Add to .env file
PIPEDREAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-pipedream-workflow-url.m.pipedream.net
```

**Verification**:
1. Book new appointment
2. Check database: `calendar_event_id` should have a value
3. Check Google Calendar: Event should exist
4. Test cancellation: Event should be updated/deleted

## üìù Conclusion

### Summary

The test successfully demonstrated:
- ‚úÖ User registration works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Appointment booking UI is functional and intuitive
- ‚úÖ Appointment data is saved to database
- ‚úÖ Doctor portal displays appointment information

However, **3 critical bugs** were discovered:
1. **Date mismatch** - Selected date not matching saved date
2. **Calendar page broken** - Not displaying appointments
3. **Google Calendar integration missing** - No sync occurring

### Impact Assessment

**User Impact**:
- **High**: Date bug causes appointments to be scheduled on wrong day
- **High**: Calendar page unusable for viewing appointments
- **Medium**: No Google Calendar sync means manual calendar management required

### Recommendation

**Priority**: Address date bug and calendar display issues **before production deployment**.

Google Calendar integration is important for user experience but can be deployed as a follow-up enhancement if timeline is critical.
