# Appointment Approval System - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Changed?

### For Patients:
1. **Can't double-book**: Slots that are already booked or pending approval are disabled
2. **Approval required**: All new appointments need doctor approval before confirmation
3. **Google Calendar notifications**: Get a calendar invitation email when doctor approves (automatic, no setup needed!)

### For Doctors:
1. **Review pending requests**: See all pending appointments on dashboard (amber highlight)
2. **Approve or reject**: Click buttons to approve or reject appointments
3. **Auto-sync to calendar**: Approved appointments automatically sync to Google Calendar
4. **Automatic notifications**: Google Calendar sends email invitations to both you and the patient

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd "/Users/abdullah/my projects/pipedream"
python migrate_approval_system.py
```

### 2. Restart Backend
```bash
cd "/Users/abdullah/my projects/pipedream"
source .venv/bin/activate  # if using virtual environment
python api/main.py
```

### 3. Frontend is Ready! ✅
No changes needed - everything auto-updates

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Google Calendar Invitations Not Sending?
Check:
1. Google Calendar integration is properly configured
2. Calendar sync is enabled in the system
3. Check backend logs for calendar sync errors
4. Verify patient has valid email in their profile

### Slots Still Clickable After Booking?
1. Refresh the availability (go back and select date again)
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify database has `booked_slots` data

### Approve/Reject Not Working?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint is running
3. Check that appointment is in `pending_approval` status
4. Restart backend server
