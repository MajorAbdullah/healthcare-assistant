# Environment Configuration Summary

## ‚úÖ All Environment Checks Passed!

### Backend Environment Variables (`.env`)
All required environment variables are properly configured in `/Users/abdullah/my projects/pipedream/.env`:

- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Set and valid (for AI chat)
- ‚úÖ `PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID` - Set (for calendar integration)
- ‚úÖ `PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID` - Set (for calendar integration)
- ‚úÖ `PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET` - Set (for calendar integration)
- ‚úÖ `EXTERNAL_USER_ID` - Set (optional)

### Frontend Environment

**Important:** Frontend does NOT need any environment variables or API keys!

- All API calls go through the backend at `http://localhost:8000`
- API keys are ONLY stored in backend `.env` file
- This is the secure, recommended approach
- Frontend only needs to know the backend URL (already configured)

### Database Status

‚úÖ **SQLite Database**: All tables present and populated
- users: 17 records
- doctors: 3 records  
- appointments: 16 records
- doctor_availability: 30 records
- conversations: 26 records
- user_preferences: 1 record

‚úÖ **Vector Database (ChromaDB)**: Initialized with medical knowledge
- Collection: stroke_medical_docs
- Documents: 45 medical documents indexed

## Latest Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Manager Method Fix
**Issue**: API was calling `add_conversation()` but method is named `save_conversation()`

**Fixed in**: `api/main.py`
- Changed `memory_manager.add_conversation()` ‚Üí `memory_manager.save_conversation()`
- Updated in both REST endpoint and WebSocket endpoint

## How to Start the Application

### 1. Start Backend (Terminal 1):
```bash
cd "/Users/abdullah/my projects/pipedream"
python3 api/main.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
üè• Healthcare Assistant API Starting...
============================================================
üì° API Server: http://localhost:8000
üìö API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
üîå WebSocket: ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/{user_id}
============================================================
```

### 2. Start Frontend (Terminal 2):
```bash
cd "/Users/abdullah/my projects/pipedream/Frontend"
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
VITE v5.4.19  ready in 176 ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

## Testing Checklist

After restarting the servers, test:

1. ‚úÖ **AI Chat**
   - Login as patient
   - Go to "Ask Medical Questions"
   - Send a message about stroke
   - Should receive AI response with citations

2. ‚úÖ **Doctor Dashboard**
   - Login as doctor
   - Dashboard should load without errors
   - Stats should display
   - Today's schedule should show

3. ‚úÖ **Patient Profile**
   - Edit profile information
   - Toggle preferences
   - Save changes
   - Should persist

4. ‚úÖ **Appointments**
   - Book new appointment
   - View appointments
   - Cancel appointment
   - All should work

## Environment Validation Script

You can run the environment check anytime:

```bash
python3 check_environment.py
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify all environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Check database tables exist
- ‚úÖ Verify vector database is initialized
- ‚úÖ Test RAG engine can load
- ‚úÖ Confirm Python dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Validate frontend configuration

## Key Takeaways

1. **API Keys Stay in Backend**: Only the backend `.env` file needs API keys
2. **Frontend is Secure**: No sensitive data in frontend code
3. **Everything is Ready**: All checks passed, ready to test
4. **RAG Engine Works**: AI has 45 medical documents to answer questions

## Next Steps

1. Restart both servers (backend and frontend)
2. Run through Playwright tests again
3. Verify all features work
4. Document any remaining issues
