## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Connects to Pipedream for Google Calendar access
2. **AI Integration**: Uses Google Gemini for natural language processing
3. **MCP Protocol**: Leverages Model Context Protocol for tool calling
4. **Conflict Detection**: Automatically checks for scheduling conflicts
5. **Smart Scheduling**: Suggests optimal times based on your schedule

## Configuration

The calendar ID is automatically detected from your primary Google Calendar. The default timezone is set to Asia/Karachi (UTC+5). You can modify these in the code if needed.

## Error Handling

- Automatic retry logic for API overload
- Clear error messages for user guidance
- Graceful handling of network issues
